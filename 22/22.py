Pydantic 

Pydantic is a powerful data validation and settings management library for Python that leverages Python's type annotations.

Key Features:
  Data Validation: Ensures that the input data conforms to the expected types. 
  Type Coercion: Automatically converts compatible types (e.g., strings to integers). 
  Nested Models: Supports defining nested data structures. 
  Error Reporting: Provides detailed error messages when validation fails. 
  Settings Management: Simplifies configuration management by loading settings from environment variables and other sources. 

Pip install pydantic 

Pydantic dependencies:
  ● pydantic-core: Core validation logic for pydantic written in rust. 
  ● typing-extensions: Backport of the standard library typing module. 
  ● annotated-types: Reusable constraint types to use with typing.Annotated.
