● Streamlit will be used for the frontend, providing a user interface for managing developers and projects. 
● FastAPI will handle the backend, managing the logic for handling API requests. 
● Pydantic will be used to define and validate the data models. 

● app.py: This will contain the Streamlit code for the user interface. 
● main.py: This will contain the FastAPI backend code. 
● models.py: This will contain the Pydantic models for data validation. 

We begin by defining the data models using Pydantic, which will ensure that the data we receive is correctly formatted and validated before any processing. 
● Developer model: This model has two attributes: name (a required string) and experience (an optional integer). 
● Project model: This model includes attributes for the project's title, description, languages used (a list of strings), and a lead developer (which is itself a Developer model). 

Next, we will implement the FastAPI backend, which will handle incoming POST requests for creating developers and projects. 
● create_developer: This endpoint takes a Developer object as input and returns a success message along with the developer data. 
● create_project: This endpoint takes a Project object as input and returns a success message along with the project data. 
● get_projects: This is an additional GET endpoint that returns a list of projects. Here, we've added a sample project for demonstration purposes, but in a real application, you would fetch the project data from a database.
